This program can be run by running the following commands:

> cd mboyt_game
> make
> ./my_game

Controls:
Press the RIGHT key to run. The player will stay stationary on the screen, but the background will scroll to the left, until it reaches the end of the map. When you lift the RIGHT key, the player will switch to an idle state and the background will stop scrolling.

I have created a game that features a character running through the halls of a school.
I downloaded a large sprite sheet from https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/frisky-girl-game-sprites-suitable-side-477429772, and used Photoshop to make a smaller sprite sheet out of the elements I needed for this assignment.

My two sprite animations are an "idle" state, which is a 4 frame animation, and a "running" state, which is a 6 frame animation.

I created my own tilesheet on Adobe Illustrator, which includes an image of a door from https://wpclipart.com/buildings/door_gate/office_door.png.html#google_vignette, and a water fountain from https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media-library/images/water-drinking-fountain-1264788?lang=eng&clang=ase, which I edited.

I have coin collectibles placed along the x-axis in increments of 200 pixels that float above the floor. I downloaded the coin image from https://w7.pngwing.com/pngs/1003/599/png-transparent-pixel-art-mario-coin-text-rectangle-%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B0.png.
